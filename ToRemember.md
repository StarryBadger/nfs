- Shaunak do path from present directory before inserting into trie (ss.c)
- discuss sendong data in chunks instead of 1024
- see if path of ss assumption is correct (all files in the directory executable is run in)
- see if multiple thread created and passing value we will need to malloc or not(??)
- remeber to write D after every slash except the last one which may be D or F
- remeber to do the above everywhere the trie is inserted into
- SHAUNAK add CREATE_DIR as list of options for client (DONE)
- metadata error handling
